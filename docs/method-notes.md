# Method Notes: IRR and NPV

## Net Present Value (NPV)

NPV discounts future cash flows back to present value using a specified discount rate. It answers the question: “What is the total value of this project today?”

### Formula:
\[
NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t}
\]

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

IRR is the discount rate that makes NPV = 0. It represents the **projected return rate** where the investment breaks even.

Use IRR for comparing multiple investment opportunities **without knowing a target discount rate**.

## Relationship Between IRR and NPV

- If IRR > required rate of return → NPV > 0 → Accept project
- If IRR < required rate → NPV < 0 → Reject
